## Problem

Rental market data is valuable but difficult to access and visualize for end users. Investors, renters, and analysts need an intuitive, responsive web application that combines real-time market data with interactive visualizations, price trend analysis, and comprehensive market insights—all backed by a production data warehouse.

## Constraints

- Need for modern, responsive UI with mobile-first design
- Real-time data integration from backend API
- Complex state management for filters, watchlists, and user preferences
- Performance optimization with caching and efficient data fetching
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance)
- Integration with Snowflake data warehouse via FastAPI backend

## Architecture

Built a modern full-stack application with clear separation of concerns:

```
Next.js 14 (TypeScript) ↔ FastAPI (Python) ↔ Snowflake Data Warehouse ↔ dbt + Dagster Pipeline
```

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Next.js 14 App Router**: Server-side rendering with dynamic routes and React Server Components
2. **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with strict mode and comprehensive interfaces
3. **Zustand State Management**: Lightweight state with localStorage persistence for user preferences
4. **API Client with Caching**: 5-minute TTL cache for optimal performance and reduced API calls
5. **Design System**: Custom design tokens with light/dark theme support and 4px rhythm

### Backend Architecture

1. **FastAPI**: High-performance async API with automatic OpenAPI documentation
2. **Snowflake Integration**: Direct queries to production data warehouse with connection pooling
3. **Pydantic Models**: Request/response validation with type safety and automatic serialization
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive HTTP status codes with structured JSON responses
5. **Docker Deployment**: Containerized application deployed on Render with auto-deploy

## Frontend Implementation

### Component Library (15+ Components)

**Core Components:**
- `SearchBar` - Autocomplete search with debouncing
- `FilterBar` - Sticky filter controls with price range, beds, baths
- `RangeSlider` - Accessible dual-thumb price slider with ARIA labels
- `ResultCard` - Property listing cards with hover effects and watchlist integration
- `MarketCard` - Market summary cards with real-time data from API

**Data Visualization:**
- `TrendChart` - Interactive price history charts with Recharts
- `Map` - MapLibre GL integration ready for geographic visualization
- `FeaturedMarketsSection` - Featured markets with loading states

**UI Components:**
- `ThemeToggle` - Light/dark/system theme switcher
- `Skeleton` - Loading placeholders with shimmer animation
- `Navbar` - Responsive navigation with mobile hamburger menu
- `Footer` - Multi-column footer with links

### State Management with Zustand

**API Data State:**
- Markets list with pagination and sorting
- Featured markets by heat score
- Price drops with threshold filtering
- Selected market details and trends
- Loading and error states per resource

**Local State:**
- Watchlist with localStorage persistence
- Price alerts and notifications
- Filter preferences (price range, beds, baths)
- Theme preference (light/dark/system)
- Map view state (center, zoom)

### Design System

**Design Tokens:**
- **Colors**: Light/dark themes with neutral, brand (blue), accent (teal), semantic colors
- **Typography**: Inter font with 8 size scales (xs to 4xl)
- **Spacing**: 4px rhythm system [4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64]
- **Shadows**: 4 levels (xs, sm, md, lg) for depth hierarchy
- **Motion**: 3 durations (fast, medium, slow) with cubic-bezier easings
- **Breakpoints**: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)

### Performance Optimization

- **Smart Caching**: 5-minute TTL cache at API client level
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports for heavy components
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with automatic optimization
- **Bundle Splitting**: Code splitting by route for faster initial load
- **Skeleton Loading**: Smooth loading states prevent layout shift

## Backend Implementation

### FastAPI REST API

**9 Production Endpoints:**
- `GET /v1/markets` - List all markets with pagination and state filtering
- `GET /v1/markets/{slug}` - Get specific market details with metadata
- `GET /v1/markets/{slug}/trends` - Historical rent trends (30/90 days)
- `GET /v1/prices/drops` - Markets with significant price decreases
- `GET /v1/prices/featured` - Top featured markets by heat score
- `GET /v1/economics/correlation` - Rent vs inflation analysis
- `GET /v1/regional/summary` - State and regional aggregations
- `GET /v1/data/lineage` - Data quality monitoring
- `GET /v1/health` - System health check

### API Features

**Standardized Responses:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "total_count": 100,
    "returned_count": 20,
    "data_freshness": "2024-10-13",
    "sources": ["Zillow ZORI", "ApartmentList"],
    "quality_score": 95
  },
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Comprehensive HTTP status codes (400, 404, 422, 500)
- Structured error responses with detail messages
- Graceful degradation on database connection failures
- Request validation with Pydantic models

**Query Parameters:**
- Flexible filtering (state, limit, offset, threshold)
- Sorting options (growth, heat_score, name)
- Pagination with limit/offset
- Input validation and sanitization
